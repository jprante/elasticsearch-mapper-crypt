# Crypt field mapper plugin for Elasticsearch

The crypt mapper plugin can index the secure hash of a string field when indexing to
[Elasticsearch](http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch).

This is useful for storing and retrieving content that must be protected by
a cryptographic hash, like passwords.

Default is the SHA-256 algorithm. You can use any secure hash algorithm that is
supported by your JVM's `MessageDigest` class.

Important note: you must disable the '_source' field when using this plugin,
or your information will be stored in clear text.

Also note, the field content is transported in clear text to the indexing node. 
If you want a secure transmission, you have to use extensions that can protect 
Elasticsearch TCP/IP traffic.

It is not recommended to use MD5. See also http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/
